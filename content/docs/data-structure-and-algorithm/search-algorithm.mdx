## Binary search

Binary search is an algorithm that searches through a sorted array. Binary search does not iterate through every element of the array. Instead, it divides the search space in half at each step.

### Implementation

Now we're going to implement the binary search algorithm by making a function to do the operation using javascript. Here is the function's code:

``` js
const binarySearch = (arr, target) => {
    let low = 0
    let high = arr.length - 1

    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2)
        
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid // Found the target, return index
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1 // Search in the right half
        } else {
            high = mid - 1 // Search in the left half
        }
    }
    
    return -1 // Target not found
}
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize pointers
   - `low` (start of the array)
   - `high` (end of the array)
2. Loop until `low` exceeds `high`:
   - Find mid = Math.floor((`low` + `high`) / 2)
   - If `arr[mid] === target`, return `mid`
   - If `target` is greater than `arr[mid]`, search the right half (`low = mid + 1`)
   - If `target` is smaller than `arr[mid]`, search the left half (`high = mid - 1`)
3. Return `-1` if not found.



## Sequential search

Sequential (or linear) search is an algorithm that checks each element of an array one by one sequentialy. It is useful for searching in unsorted arrays.

 
### Implementation

Now we're going to implement the Sequential search algorithm by making a function to do the operation using javascript. Here is the function's code:

```js
const array = [12, 43, 435, 56, 7867, 78]

const sequentialSearch = (arr, target) => {
    for (let i = 0 i < arr.length i++) {
        if (arr[i] === target) {
            return i // Return index if found
        }
    }
    return -1 // Target not found
}

console.log(sequentialSearch(array, 56)) // => 3
```

### Explanation

1. Define the function:
   -The function sequentialSearch takes two parameters: an array and a target value.
2. Loop through the array:
   - Iterate over each element.
   - If an element matches the target, return its index.
3. Return -1 if the target is not found.

## Addition

Binary search is works only for sorted array and fast for larger datasets. <br/>
Sequential search is works for any array but slower for large datasets
