# Introduction

React followed [**component-based**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/component-based-architecture-system-design/) architecture. Component in React is a isolated and reusable bits of code. There is two types of component, which is **class component**  and **functional component.**

Before React version 16, developers can only using React features like state only in **class component,** but with version 16.8 React introduced a new featured called hooks. With React hooks we can use common React feature like state not only in **class component** but also in **functional component.**

# Hooks in React

React hooks is a function that enable functional component to use React state and lifecycle features. React hooks eliminate the need for **class component,** making the code easier to read, cleaner and maintain.

## Basic hooks in React

In this article I will only briefly discuss the basic hooks that are often used in React, for more details, you can check the [official documentation] (https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).

### 1. useState

useState is a React hook that allows you to create and manage state in React functional component, here is an example of using the useState hook

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0); //[!code highlight]
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => 
                setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

<Callout>
useState return a two variable that can be destructed, which they are the state name on the first index and the state setter on the second index
</Callout>

### 2. useEffect

useEffect is a React hook that allows you to handle side effects and synchronize a component with external systems. It can be used to manage a component's lifecycle, such as fetching data, managing subscriptions, or performing DOM manipulations.

Here is an example of using react useEffect hook by creating a simple Timer component

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function Timer() {
    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => 
            setSeconds((s) => s + 1), 1000);
            
        return () => clearInterval(interval); 
    }, []);

    return <h1>Time: {seconds}s</h1>;
}
```

- **Explanation**
    
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => 
            setSeconds((s) => s + 1), 1000);
        return () => clearInterval(interval); // cleanup function
    }, []);
    
    ```
    
    **Purpose**: This `useEffect` sets up a repeating action (a timer) and cleans it up when the component unmounts. 
    
    Inside the `useEffect`:
    
    1. **`setInterval`**:  This function run s a callback every 1000 mililseconds (1 second), the callback updates the `seconds` state by incrementing it by 1
    2. **Cleanup Function**: The `return` statement defines a cleanup function, which React calls when the component unmount or the dependecies change, using `clearInterval` to Prevents memory leaks by stopping the interval when the component is removed from the DOM. 
    3. **Empty Dependency Array (`[]`)**: This ensure the effect runs only once, similar to `componentDidMount` in class component

### 3. useRef

Refs let a component to [hold some information that isnâ€™t used for rendering](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs), you can store an information like DOM node using ref. Unlike state updating the ref does not trigger the re-rendering process.

Here is an example of using React useRef hooks, by creating simle input that will automatically focus if the button clicked.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function Focus() {
    const input = useRef();

    const focus = () => input.current.focus();

    return (
        <div>
            <input ref={input} type="text" />
            <button onClick={focus}>Focus</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

- **Explanation**
    
    1. **Using `useRef` to Create a Reference**
    
    ```jsx
    const input = useRef(); // initiate the ref
    ```
    
    - The `useRef` hook creates a reference (`input`) that can be attached to a DOM element.
    - This reference remains the same across renders and allows you to interact with the DOM element directly via the `.current` property.
    1. **Attaching the Ref to the input element**
    
    ```jsx
    <input ref={input} type="text" />
    ```
    
    - The `ref` attribute links the `input` reference to the `<input>`
    1. Focus function
    
    ```jsx
    const focus = () => input.current.focus();
    ```
    
    - **What It Does**:
        - When called, this function accesses the `current` property of the `input` reference, which points to the DOM element (`<input/>`)
        - The `.focus()` method is a built-in DOM method that moves the browserâ€™s focus to the input field, making it active and ready for user input

Other than these hooks there is also a lot of React hooks that you can [learn more](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).

# Custom hooks

Custom hooks is a hook that we create to encapsulate the reusable logic, Custom hook will enhance the code reusability and readability by sharing the same behavior between a component.

Here is an example of creating a custom hook that used to kwon the screen size:  

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useScreenSize() {
    const [screenSize, setScreenSize] = useState({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
    });

    useEffect(() => {
        const handleResize = () => {
            //change the screenSize state value
            setScreenSize({
                width: window.innerWidth,
                height: window.innerHeight,
            });
        };

        // Add the resize event listener
        window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

        // Cleanup the event listener on component unmount
        return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    }, []);

    return screenSize;
}

export default useScreenSize;

```

- Explanation
    
    The `useScreenSize` hook is a custom React hook designed to track the browser's screen dimensions in real-time. It returns the current width and height of the screen and updates these values whenever the window is resized.
    
- How to use the useScreenSize hook
    
    ```jsx
    import React from "react";
    import useScreenSize from "./useScreenSize";
    
    function ScreenSizeComponent() {
        // destruct the useScreensize return value
        const { width, height } = useScreenSize();
    
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Screen Size</h1>
                <p>Width: {width}px</p>
                <p>Height: {height}px</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
    
    export default ScreenSizeComponent;
    
    ```
    

# Benefits of using hooks

Hooks can improve code readability and reusability also make it easier to split complex components into smaller functions.

- **Simpler, cleaner code:**Â Functional components with hooks are often more concise and easier to understand than class components.
- **Better for complex UIs**: Hooks make it easier to manage state and side effects in components with intricate logic.
- **Improved maintainability**: Code using hooks is often easier to test and debug.

# Conclusion

React hooks is one of the basic fundamental you need to know, because it can enhance you code reusability, readability and even performance for you app, I hope you can learn more about the [React hooks from the official docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)
