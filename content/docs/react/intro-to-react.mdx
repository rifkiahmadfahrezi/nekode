# What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for build dynamic and interactive UI (user interface), React developed and maintained by Facebook. React gains so many popularity due to its efficient **rendering techniques**, **reusable components**, and active community support.

## React basic concepts

### 1. JSX (Javascript XML)

JSX is a syntax extension for React, JSX allows developers to write HTML elements in Javascript, using JSX in react is not mandatory, but using JSX it will make the development process alot easier in read and writing codes.

```jsx
// Using JSX
const ele = <h1>This is sample JSX</h1>;
 
// Using plain JavaScript
const ele = React.createElement('h1', null, 'This is sample JSX');
```

### 2. Component

Component are independent reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose like a function, but instead of returning value like number or boolean component returning HTML element.

In React you can create a component using two methods, using class component and using functional component, here is an example of creating component using class component and functional component.

**Example class component**

```jsx
import React from 'react'

class Hello extends React.Component {  
		render() {
		    return <h1>Hello Nekode!</h1>;  
		}
}
```

**Example function component**

```jsx
import React from 'react'
 
function Hello(){
	return (
		<h1>Hello Nekode!</h1>
	)
}
```

### 3. State

**State** is a JavaScript object that holds data that can be used to influence the rendering of a component. In simple terms, think of it as any piece of information that can change over time and impact how your component appears or behaves. 

The state allows developers to create dynamic and interactive UIs by enabling components to respond to user input, API responses, or other events.

### 4. Virtual DOM

React uses Virtual DOM to optimize updates on web page, So every object that exists in the original DOM will have the copy of the object in React Virtual DOM, DOM and Virtual DOM is the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document.

How virtual DOM works is basically everything in React is component, and component can contain a State, so every time the state change occurs , the virtual DOM is updated first, this update is happen super quick because doesn't involve direct interaction with the user interface. 

React will only update a component if the state changes with “diffing” algorithm by comparing the new virtual DOM and the previous version.
