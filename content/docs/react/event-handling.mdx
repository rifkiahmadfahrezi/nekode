# Introduction

[Event handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) is the most fundamental understanding to make you website more interactive, even though youâ€™re not using any frontend framework.

On this article weâ€™re not going deep about event handling, but this article will cover a basic introduction of event handling in React, including how to:

- Create an event
- Passing an event handler as props

# Create an event

To create an event in React, you just have to attach the event name to the element that will fire it, this is the example for event handling in React on a button element

 

```jsx
function handler(){
	alert("hello world")
}

<button onClick={handler}>
	click me
</button>
```

You can pass an event handler function like this 

`onClick={handler}` or like this `onClick={() â‡’ handler()}` 

You can also pass an arguments if you called a handler like the second way

</aside>

# Passing an event handler as props

Passing an event handler as a props is a common practice is React, by passing an event handler as props you can make your component more reuseable.

For example weâ€™re going to make **Button** component that can accept an `onClick` event that will show an alert dialog with text `halo my name is ...` ****(the dots will replace to name variable from an arguments), here is the code

Button.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export function Button({ handler }){
	return (
		<button onClick={handler} >
			click me
		</button>
	)
}
```

**Explanation**

1. Add props `handler` to send the event handler function to the **button** element
    
    `Button({ handler })`
    
2. Attach the `handler` props to the `onClick` event
    
    `<button onClick={handler} >`
    

By following this code you can make your button element can accept an event handler to the children element, example usage to the parent component

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Button from './components/Button'

export function App(){
	function handler(name){
		alert(`Halo my name is ${name}`)
	}

	return (
   <div>
         Halo
         <Button handler={()=> handler("Nekode")} />
   </div>
	)
}
```

## Handling multiple events

If you want to handle alot of events in your single element on component you use the [rest parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) to the props, here is the example

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export function Button({ ...props }){
	return (
		<button {...props}>
			click me
		</button>
	)
}
```

By using rest parameter, not only event handler but the rest of elements attributes like **id, className, etc**. you can also pass it to the props component, here is the result
