After purchasing we have to do initial configuration such as installing firewall, nodejs, nginx and so on.

### Remote access configuration via SSH

1. Prepare a terminal, you can also use git bash or powershell on Windows
2. Login as the `root` user by entering the command

```bash
ssh root@your_ip
# e.g ssh root@123.123
```

3. Update the Linux package

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
```

4. Create a new user to separate the root user (you could say admin) and other users

```bash
# add new user
adduser username
# e.g adduser nekode
```

5. Add the newly created user to the sudo group, then log out of the server

```bash
usermod -aG sudo username
# e.g usermod -aG sudo nekode
logout
```

6. Log back in with the newly created user

```bash
ssh username@your_ip
# e.g ssh nekode@123.123
```

7. Check if the user is already in the sudo group, if the command below does not display an error then the user is already in the sudo group

```bash
sudo -v
```

8. Create a folder for the SSH key, after running the command make sure the folder is successfully created by running the command `ls -a`

```bash
mkdir ~/.s sh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

9. Log out of the server to create an SSH key on our computer (if it already exists, you can skip it)

```bash
logout
```

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

10. Send the SSH key to the server
- Windows

 ```bash
 scp $env:USERPROFILE/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <username>@<your-server-ip>:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 ```

 - Mac:

 ```bash
 scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <username>@<your-server-ip>:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 ```

 - Linux:

 ```bash
 ssh-copy-id <username>@<your-server-ip>
 ```

11. Log in to the server again as the newly created user

 ```bash
 ssh username@your_ip
 # e.g ssh nekode@123.123
 ```

12. Turn off logging into the `root` user via SSH, so that the user `root` can only be accessed in the hostinger panel terminal browser, how to open the SSH config file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

then search down by clicking the arrow on the keyboard until you see the `PermitRootLogin yes` config, then change it to `PermitRootLogin no`.

If you have clicked `ctrl + x` then press `y` to save the changed config

13. Restart SSH

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
# if error try sshd
```

14. Done!, to make sure you can access the server via SSH and have turned off the `root` user login access via SSH you can log out and log back in as the `root` user and as the newly created user.

```bash
ssh root@your_ip
# login as root user
```

```bash
ssh username@your_ip
# login as new user
```

If the `root` user login fails even though the password is correct, while the login as the newly created user is successful, then we have successfully configured SSH access.

### Security configuration (firewall)

A firewall is useful for securing our server from unwanted attacks. Here is how to install a firewall:

1. Install firewall

```bash
sudo apt install ufw
```

2. Whitelist port, the purpose is to give access to certain ports so that they can access the server

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```

3. Enable firewall

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

4. Check firewall status

```bash
sudo ufw firewall
```

5. Add new rules to the firewall to block pings to the server
1. Open firewall rules

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules
```

2. Find the `INPUT` block below and add these rules

```bash
-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP
```

{/* ![image.png](attachment:b0b9720a-c7f2-4c9e-b1e5-7db8d70d5e6f:image.png) */}

6. Reboot the server, wait a few moments and then try logging in again

```bash
sudo reboot
```
### Nginx configuration

1. install Nginx

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Create an Nginx configuration file, then enter the following text

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextjs.conf
```

```
server {
listen 80;
server_name your_server_ip;

location / {
proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
proxy_http_version 1.1;
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
 proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
 proxy_set_header Host $host;
 proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

 # Disable buffering to allow streaming responses
 proxy_buffering off;
 proxy_set_header X-Accel-Buffering no;
 }
}
```

Change the `your_server_ip` with your server IP, If you have to save the changes, click `ctrl + x` then `y` to save the changes

3. Activate the Nginx configuration file that we just created

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextjs.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

4. Delete the default configuration so that there is no conflict

```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

To check whether the config file is correct, you can run this command

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

5. Restart Nginx

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

### Configure the required packages (Nodejs or Bun)

Now we will install the required packages so that we can run the application on the server

**Nodejs Installation**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo -E bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
```

Check if the installation was successful by running `node -v` and `npm -v` , if you want to use PNPM you can install it by following [how to install pnpm here](https://pnpm.io/installation#on-posix-systems)

**Bun Installation**

In addition to Nodejs you can also use Bun,
