## VPS specifications and how to purchase

For VPS purchases, I bought it at Hostinger, with the KVM 1 package, the specifications offered are sufficient to learn to deploy simple applications including using Docker.

Here are the details of the VPS specifications from the KVM 1 package:

- **1** vCPU core
- **4 GB** RAM
- **50 GB** NVMe disk space
- **4 TB** bandwidth
- **Data Center** Worldwide
- **Linux** operating system

### VPS Purchase

For how to purchase you can follow these steps, make sure you already have an account at hostinger:

1. Select the KVM 1 package, you can use the link belowâ¬‡
<Callout>
[Buy here](https://www.hostinger.co.id/cart?product=vps%3Avps_kvm_1&period=12&referral_type=cart_link&REFERRALCODE=N4ERIFKIAHBV&referral_id=0195ee91-c770-735b-b7ac-c759834b67b7)
By purchasing using the link above you can save 20% if you buy a minimum of 12 months, but if you want to buy for 1 month only the 20% discount will be forfeited, but you can try using the coupon code VPS10 to get a 10% discount
</Callout>
2. Select the duration as desired, then select the server location with the lowest latency (I chose India 77ms)
3. Select the operating system, because our goal is to learn, select "Plain OS" then select the latest version of Ubuntu
4. Then fill in the address and payment method you want
5. If the payment is successful you will be directed to a new page where you will be asked whether to activate the malware scanner feature or not (I chose no)
6. Then you are asked to create a password, make sure the password is **easy for you to remember,** then click continue then your VPS will be created by Hostinger
7. Continue clicking **Manage VPS** to visit the VPS panel that we just bought at Hostinger
