## Introduction

Nowadays that's so many free and paid platforms that you can use to deploy your web application like vercel, netlify and so on, but learn self-hosting will make you  become a more skilled developer and have more control over your projects. Hereâ€™s some reason you should consider learning self-hosting.

### More control over your infrastucture
With self-hosting, you have full control over server configurations, caching, domains, and security settings. On platforms like Vercel, you are limited by their configurations and policies.

### Cost Efficiency for Large-Scale Projects
Platform like Vercel has a free plan that is great for small projects, but as your project scales, it can become expensive. With self-hosting, you can optimize resources and only pay for what you truly need.

### Better Learning & Career Growth
Understanding how to set up, configure, and manage servers makes you a better developer. Many companies prefer developers who know how to deploy and maintain applications on the server beyond just using managed services.
